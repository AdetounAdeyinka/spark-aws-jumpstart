In the first part, we are going to have the following goals:

## Submitting HW
We will use the git workflow for submitting HW (it's pass or fail)
1. fork the repo on github
2. clone it from your name
`git clone http://github.com/your-gh-name/spark-aws-jumpstart.git`
3. create and checkout feature branch
`git checkout -b yourName-hw`
4. complete the assignment and stage your chages
`git add my-file`
5. commit with proper commit message
`git commit -m "chore: adding assignment 1"`
6. push your changes to your repo
`git push origin yourName-hw`
7. open a PR on github and submit
8. party time :tada:
